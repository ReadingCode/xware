About xware

x means any, xware stands for x-software, which means a framework for easing creating any application based on C++.
Under development of xWorkshop, it also contains applications developed based on the framework.

How to build

In order to build the components of xware, you need to install Python(http://www.python.org) and SCons(http://www.scons.org).
You will also need boost(http://www.boost.org) and GMock(http://code.google.com/p/googlemock) library before you can build.
Once you have Python and SCons, and all libraries setup, locate to the root folder of xware, then type:

    scons -f <component>.scons

This command will build the component with default options. The output will be in the <component>_output folder, which is also under the root of xware.
The build commaond accepts the following options:
    unicode=<yes|no> - Build the component with wide charset, default to yes
    release=<yes|no> - Build the component without debug information, default to no
    arch=<x86|i386|amd64|emt64|x86_64|ia64> - Build the component for specific architecture, default the current archtecture
    windows=<win2k3|win7|win2k|winvista|winxp> - For Windows only, used for define WINNT macro, default to current system value
    boost=<path_to_boost> - The path for where to find boost
    gmock=<path_to_gmock> - The path for where to find gmock, note this should be pointing to gmock fused source folder
You could run the following command for getting detail option information:

    scons -f <component>.scons -h

The script named build_<compoent>_all.py under xware root folder is a handy way for build cooresponding compoent with mixed configurations.
